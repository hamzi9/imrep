<h2>MEDIA DIRECTOR</h2>
<p>It’s great to be here to start what I hope will be 48 hours of debate about the future of news</p>
<p>I want to begin today not with the big picture but with a small one. And here it is</p>
<p>That was Earl Marchant, a single parent from Manchester, a couple of hundred miles south of Edinburgh. He lost his job ten years ago - in the teeth of the financial crisis</p>
<p>We put him at the heart of our tenth anniversary coverage of the crisis just recently. Coverage that also included long reads, digital videos, short explainers - as well as the more recognisable pieces on radio and television</p>
<p>I'm saying this because it says something quite simple but important about our journalism, because our job - as it always has been - is to put Earl Marchant first. By that I mean put the audience first</p> 
<p>How does he, and millions of people like him, make sense of a world which he’s often told is in chaos a world which can feel polarised, noisy and full of misinformation?</p> 
<p>I believe our role is straightforward. To fulfil our responsibility to Earl. To the audience</p>
<p>But to do that we need to look carefully in the mirror. We know just how many challenges we have to navigate in fact, given our unique purpose, we have a duty to navigate</p>
<p>HAVE A GOOD DAY ALL</p>
<p>!!!!!!!</p>

<h2>SENIOR EDITOR</h2>
<P>The News Editor is one of the most important persons who plans a daily newspaper.</P>
<p> His role in any newspaper office-whether it be weekly or daily-is all pervading</p>
<P>To a national newspaper an active, intelligent and enterprising news editor is the vital spark which energises its news coverage and outlook</P>
<P>An ideal news editor manages to get all the obvious stories into his paper with a good proportion of them as exclusives. While the selection of obvious stories is impor­tant, greater importance is attached to the original ones produced by his team of correspondents</P>
<P>The news editor is called upon to use his discretion, discrimination and imagination in reading the public mind and select the stories which have real news value and can be called important by his readers-quite a large number to be allotted a "splash" position on the main news pages according to the subject matter 01 field of activity they are concerned with</P>
<P>All this has to be done carefully and with an alertness to ensure that the kind of stories readers seek shall be found in his newspaper</P>
<p>HAVE A GOOD DAY ALL</p>
<p>!!!!!!!</p>
